## Inspiration
Having so much experiences in my country of citizens that do not obbey mandatory quarantine restrictions imposed by the government. Enhacing CoV-2 spreading speed.

## What it does
This mobile application allows federal, provincial and municipal governments to enforce mandatory quarantine restrictions to the population during SARS-COVID-19 pandemic by implementing personalized minimum time intervals in order to go out and buy comestibles (e.g.: once every 7 days) for each person. 

## How I built it
Using Java, Android Studio & Google Firebase

## Challenges I ran into
Achieving verification of userÂ´s data input

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Developing this project with tech with excelent perfomance, even if it took me more time. Rather than using React Native to speed up development but having a less performant application.

## What I learned

## What's next for Qarantine.IO
    - Permanent authorization to essential personnel (health professionals, security and armed forces and government officials)
    - Unauthorize citizens that have recently arrived from other countries to leave their residences for 14 days
    - Record citizens violating enforced mandatory quarantine by leaving their residence when their status is unauthorized. Making easier further legal punishments
