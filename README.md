# Quarantine.IO #

## What it does ##
Mobile application that assists governments in imposing and enforcing mandatory quarantine restrictions upon citizens

## How it works ##
Individuals to register by sending their data and a picture of their natonal identification document. User data will be checked by image recognition A.I. that will verify if it matches with  data found in the uploaded picture. After being verified, the individual will be able to generate a QR code. Authorities will be able to scan with their camera that QR code and evaluate if that subject is allowed or not to go out of his home.

## How I built it ##
Java, Android Studio & Google Firebase

## What's next for Qarantine.IO ##
In first place it lacks a feature that allows grantinig permanent authorization to essential personnel (health professionals, security and armed forces and government officials). Also unauthorize citizens that have recently arrived from other countries to leave their residences for 14 days. Finally, record citizens violating enforced mandatory quarantine by leaving their residence when their status is unauthorized. Making easier further legal punishments
